# 10 — Voting Mechanic

## Purpose

Define the UI behaviour and data flow for the **review-thread voting system**.
This specification governs the `VoteBar` component and its interaction with the
back-end voting API. General thread lifecycle rules remain in
**07-proof-and-approval.md**; this document focuses on the **presentation,
persistence, and interaction details** of the voting UI.

---

## Component: `VoteBar`

Located at `src/components/dialogs/vote-bar.tsx`.

### Props

| Prop              | Type              | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `threadId`        | `string`          | Review thread ID used in vote API calls.                     |
| `votes`           | `ReviewVote[]`    | Snapshot of all current votes on the thread.                 |
| `currentUserId`   | `string \| null`  | Authenticated user's ID — used to highlight their own vote.  |
| `threadOpen`      | `boolean`         | Whether the thread is still open.                            |
| `onVoteSubmitted` | `() => void`      | Callback fired after a vote is persisted (triggers refresh). |

### Rendering Rules

- **The component is only rendered for non-owner team members.** The parent
  (`CellThreadDialog`) gates its visibility via the `isOwner` prop.
- When `threadOpen` is `false`, the vote buttons are disabled but the results
  bar and any previously cast vote remain visible.

---

## Vote Buttons

Two buttons: **Accept** and **Deny**.

### Visual Behaviour

| State               | Accept button                                  | Deny button                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Default (no vote)    | Outline style                                  | Outline style                                |
| Hover                | Light green background (`green-100`)           | Light red background (`red-100`)             |
| Pressed / Active     | Slightly deeper green (`green-200`)            | Slightly deeper red (`red-200`)              |
| **Selected** (voted) | Solid green (`green-600`), white text           | Solid red (`red-600`), white text            |
| Disabled (closed)    | Standard disabled appearance                    | Standard disabled appearance                 |

### Interaction

- Clicking a button submits (or updates) the user's vote via
  `POST /api/threads/[threadId]/vote`.
- A user **may change their vote** as long as the thread is open (spec 07 §
  Voting Rules).
- After a successful vote, the `onVoteSubmitted` callback triggers a thread
  refetch so the votes array — and therefore the button state — is refreshed.

---

## Results Bar

A horizontal bar displayed below the buttons.

### Layout

- Full width, rounded, fixed height (4 px / `h-4`).
- **Left portion** — green (`green-500`) — represents the *accept* share.
- **Right portion** — red (`red-500`) — represents the *deny* share.
- Each portion displays the absolute count as a small label.

### Empty State

- When **no votes** have been cast, the bar is solid grey (`gray-300`) with a
  centred "No votes yet" label.

### Accessibility

- `role="progressbar"` with `aria-label`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`,
  `aria-valuemax` attributes.

---

## Data Flow

```
User clicks Accept/Deny
        │
        ▼
POST /api/threads/[threadId]/vote  ──▶  submitVote() (DB)
        │
        ▼
   onVoteSubmitted()
        │
        ▼
   refetchThread()  ──▶  GET /api/threads/[threadId]
        │
        ▼
   VoteBar re-renders with updated votes[]
```

Votes are **persisted server-side** in the `review_votes` table (unique
constraint on `(thread_id, voter_user_id)`). The `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
clause handles vote changes transparently.

---

## Persistence & Database Notes

The existing `review_votes` table already stores votes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE review_votes (
  id           VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  thread_id    VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  voter_user_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  vote         ENUM('accept', 'deny') NOT NULL,
  created_at   DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at   DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE KEY unique_vote (thread_id, voter_user_id),
  …
);
```

**No schema migration is required** for the current feature set. The existing
columns are sufficient to:

- Store one vote per user per thread.
- Allow vote changes (`ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`).
- Return all votes with their voter IDs for the results bar.

### Potential Future Migrations

If requirements grow, consider:

| Change | Reason |
| ------ | ------ |
| Add `voter_username` denormalized column on `review_votes` | Avoid a JOIN when displaying *who* voted (not currently shown in the bar). |
| Add `accept_count` / `deny_count` cached columns on `review_threads` | Avoid counting votes on every fetch for threads with many voters. |

## Relationship to Other Specs

- **07-proof-and-approval.md** — defines thread lifecycle, eligible voters,
  automatic closure, and outcome rules. The VoteBar implements the *client-side*
  of those rules; the server-side enforcement lives in
  `review-thread-repository.ts → submitVote()`.
- **00-system-overview.md** — high-level mention of voting as part of the review
  workflow.

---

## Out of Scope

- Server-side vote validation (already covered in spec 07).
- Thread closure logic (already implemented in `submitVote()`).
- Notification of voting outcome.
