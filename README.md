## Issues Labels

- **question**: an issue not ready to be assigned. More information is needed and the issue itself has to be formalized (i.e., provide structured information, definition of "done", specifications, etc.)
- **enhancement**: represents a new feature to be implemented
- **bug**: an issue with an already implemented feature to be solved

Before closing an issue, remember to **update the specifications accordingly** (`specs/` folder and `AGENTS.md`). Add new Markdown files if necessary.
