## 2.0.2 - is_empty as Generated Column

A generated column allow us to ensure that the _is\_empty_ column of the _bingo\_cells_ table remains consistent upon insert and update operations.

- BOOL and BOOLEAN are synonims for TINYINT(1) in MariaDB
- A VIRTUAL generated column is not stored in the database; its value is computed only when necessary; a PERSISTENT generated column is stored as any regular column in the database.
