# API guidelines

These are guidelines for writing API routes concerning the Next.js application. Their implementation is usually in the `nextjs/src/app/api` directory.

- When writing API routes, follow RESTful conventions and use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different operations. Provide documentation comments for API routes that explain the purpose of the route, its parameters, and its expected response.
- When writing API endpoint implementations, ensure proper error messages and status codes are returned for different scenarios.
- When writing API endpoint implementations, keep in mind authentication and authorization requirements, and ensure that sensitive data is handled securely.
